Practice for PCAP

02/26/2020
This is my study and practice journal.

SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) goals:

Certify for PCAP , details https://pythoninstitute.org/certification/pcap-certification-associate/
Got a discount for PCAP from https://pythoninstitute.org/certification/pcap-certification-associate/pcap-exam-fees/
I opted for option 1 because of an existing OpenEDG Education Platform account. The difference of $3.xx didn't matter.
I'll have a checkin everyday until the exam day. March 26th 2020
